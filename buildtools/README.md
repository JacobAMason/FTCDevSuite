This folder contains:
* build.ps1: This is a powershell script used to download dependencies (Android Studio, Java, etc..) that are packaged into the installers. Those dependencies go into the data folder.
* NSIS: This is where all the NSIS dependencies go. All the includes and pluggins that NSIS needs to run are versioned here so developers don't have to install NSIS themselves.
